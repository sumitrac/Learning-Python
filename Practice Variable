# Practice-one 

# the value of 5 is assigned to the variable named x
x = 5
# the current value of x (5) is added to 1
# that sum is then assigned to the variable named x
x = x + 1

print("x =", x) 
# => x = 6 


# Practice-two 

# the value of 1 is assigned to the variable named x
x = 1
# the value stored in x is assigned to y
# note: this does not mean that x and y will always
# store the same value
y = x
# the value of 3 is assigned to the variable named x
x = 3
# note: y still holds the value of 1

print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)

# => x = 3
# => y = 1


# Practice-two 

# the value of "Rosa" is assigned to the variable named dog_name
dog_name = "Rosa"
# the value of "Raquel" is assigned to the variable named cat_name
cat_name = "Raquel"
# the value of 7 is assigned to the variable named dog_age
dog_age  = 7
# the value of 11 is assigned to the variable named cat_age
cat_age  = 11

print("The dog named", dog_name, "is", dog_age, "years old")
print("The cat named", cat_name, "is", cat_age, "years old")

# => The dog named Rosa is 7 years old
# => The cat named Raquel is 11 years old
